ENGAGE,CMU Entertainment Technology Center,"RumbleBlocks, Beanstalk, PuppyBot Rescue",,http://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/sci-fri/,,"SCI-FRI (Science Friction) is a project working towards inspiring young minds to pursue science and engineering as a career. Initiated by DARPA, this is a multi-year project working in conjunction with many different institutions and organizations, such as the Sesame Workshop and Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Human Computer Interaction Institute. The end-product will be a series of multi-platform games that apply adaptive, in-game analytics for Pre-K-3rd graders that inspires interest and teaches basic concepts in the field of science.",,UL,"C#, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, CreateJS Suite, Flash, Unity3D, 3DS Max","Large-scale analytics, learning assessments, adaptive learning technologies, optimum learning pathways"

SpaceForce runs in OurSpace, a portal built to host SpaceForce, its data and an HTML5 level editor.  Players can login & register with a unique ID to save game progress.  Plaza and Neurostorm focus on brain plasticity.  Specifically, Neurostorm trains players to focus their attention in a virtual environment, and Plaza helps to maintain the brain's agility.

,UCLA CRESST,"Go Vector Go, Team Vector, Deep Sea Dash",,http://engage.cse.ucla.edu/,,"CRESST games are designed to help young children (in grades K-3) learn advanced physics and promote scientific reasoning and socio-emotional skills.  The games promote improved understanding of the physics concepts force and motion, with emphasis on force magnitude & direction,  friction, mass, gravity, and slope.  These games also promote improved understanding of key social and emotional skills, such as anti-bullying and empathy.
