The user provides an initial seed email then enters into a cycle where ActiveSearch provides a similar email and the user reports whether or not the email was interesting.\n\nActiveSearch is useful for anyone navigating a large set of emails and looking for related messages on a specific topic. As it considers the similarities between emails as well as user feedback, it is an improvement in accuracy, time, and effort over basic text search or a brute force search.",
