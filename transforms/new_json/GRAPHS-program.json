A major focus of the program has been quantitative and structural aspects of large social networks and the attending models. The program is divided into a few thrusts, with performers working in sampling techniques for graphs, geometric embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, Gaussian Conditional Random Fields, community detection, and link prediction.
